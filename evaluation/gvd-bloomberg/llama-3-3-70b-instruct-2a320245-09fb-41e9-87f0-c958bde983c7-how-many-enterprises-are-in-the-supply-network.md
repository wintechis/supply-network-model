Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `<think>...</think>` section followed by an `<act>...</act>` section.
Use the <think> and <act> tags only for marking the sections.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `describe(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position plus more related triples describing `resource URI`. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `describe()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You can run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `<act>describe("http://foo/bar")</act>` or `<act>query("PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }")`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

When nearing about eight cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice but to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `search()`.
* Next, access representations of key resources via `describe()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `describe()` to gather information required to construct a query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `describe()`, especially domain and range of properties.
* Once you have collected the information required to write a query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `describe()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

***

on_user("How many enterprises are in the supply network?")

***

<think>The User is asking about the number of enterprises in the supply network. To answer this question, we need to identify the key resources involved, which are "enterprises" and "supply network". We can start by searching for these terms to find relevant URIs.</think>
<act>search("enterprises") | search("supply network")</act>

***

No results for `search("enterprises")`.

The search for `supply network` returned the following matches.

<think>We have found several URIs related to the "supply network" concept. The top match is https://purl.org/supply-network/onto#SupplyNetwork, which seems to be a relevant ontology for the supply network domain. Since we didn't find any results for "enterprises", we can try to find a related concept in the supply network ontology. We can use the describe action to gather more information about the supply network ontology and see if it contains any information about enterprises or similar concepts.</think>

<think>We have gathered more information about the supply network ontology. The ontology defines several classes, including `SupplyNetwork`, `Abstraction`, and `SupplyFlow`, as well as properties such as `inferredFrom`, `structure`, and `supplyFlow`. However, we still haven't found any information about enterprises. Since `SupplyNetwork` is a subclass of `qb:DataSet` and `prov:Entity`, we can try to describe these classes to see if they contain any information about enterprises or similar concepts.</think>

<think>We have gathered more information about the `qb:DataSet` and `prov:Entity` classes. However, we still haven't found any direct information about enterprises. Since `SupplyNetwork` is a subclass of `prov:Entity`, and `Abstraction` and `SupplyFlowKey` are also subclasses of `prov:Entity`, we can try to describe the `prov:Entity` class to see if it contains any properties or relationships that could lead us to information about enterprises.</think>

<think>We have already described the `prov:Entity` class and didn't find any direct information about enterprises. Let's try to think about the supply network domain and how enterprises might be related to it. In a supply network, enterprises are often referred to as organizations or agents that participate in the network. We can try to search for these terms to see if we can find any relevant information.</think>
<act>search("organization") | search("agent")</act>

No results for `search("organization")`.

No results for `search("agent")`.

<think>We didn't find any results for "organization" or "agent". Let's try to think about other terms that might be related to enterprises in the context of a supply network. We can also try to search for terms like "company" or "business" to see if we can find any relevant information.</think>
<act>search("company") | search("business")</act>

The search for `company` returned the following matches.

<think>We have found a resource that represents an enterprise, specifically the "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company". This resource is of type `ns1:Enterprise` and has several properties, including `rdfs:label`, `ns1:industry`, and `ns1:registeredInCountry`. We can use this information to construct a query that retrieves all enterprises in the supply network. We can use the `ns1:Enterprise` type to identify enterprises and count the number of instances of this type.</think>
<act>query("PREFIX ns1: <https://paul.ti.rw.fau.de/~ju32haqi/supply-networks/abstraction-examples/esn-ontology#> SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?enterprise) AS ?count) WHERE { ?enterprise a ns1:Enterprise }")</act>
