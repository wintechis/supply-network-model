Who supplies Bosch?
    - understands esn:customer and esn:supplier correctly after deref and one wrong query
    -> correct result
How many enterprises are in TSMC's supply network?
    - no result for search("TSMC")
    - esn:supplier understood in wrong direction
    - counts sn:SupplyLink instances with TSMC as supplier but checks if the instances are of type esn:Enterprise
    - does not consider transitive supply relation
    -> no results
How many enterprises are in Nvidia's supply network?
    - only looks for suppliers, but misunderstands direction of esn:supplier
    - counts sn:SupplyLink instances
    - does not consider transitive supply relation
    -> wrong result
Is Bosch part of TSMC's supply network?
    - no result for search("TSMC")
    - searches for "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company"
    - understands the QID of suppliers/customers by the URI of the sn:SupplyLink instances
    - does not understand that the hash URIs are different, tries to query direct links
    - runs into exceptions when using ASK query
    -> no result
What is the value of the contract between Qualcomm and Apple?
    - uses describe("esn:supplier")
    - looks for a contract
    - writes a query with syntax errors but understands the 400 bad request answer as the queried data not being available in the KG
    -> no result
    retry
    - fails to find information on the volume blank node
What is the total volume of trade between Nvidia and its customers?
    - finds blank nodes when querying volumes, understands to continue with a query that includes the sn:quantity property
    - sums the found quantities in the following query
    - disregards time
    -> correct result if units are identical
What country is Intel registered in?
    -> correct result
How many supply relations between enterprises from China and the USA exist?
    - no result for search("USA")
    - finds search("United States")
    - only considers customers from the USA and suppliers from China (which does not exist)
    -> wrong result
    - correct result after confronting the agent with "did the question imply the direction of the supply relation?"
What is the total volume of supply links from Taiwan to the USA?
    - no result for search("USA")
    - finds search("United States of America")
    - finds sn:SupplyFlow with search("supply links") and uses describe("sn:SupplyFlow")
    - only queries for sn:SupplyFlow instances between both countries, disregarding enterprises
    -> no result
How many enterprises are in the supply network?
    - doesn't find esn:Enterprise with search()
    - counts all enterprises in KG
    -> correct result if only one supply network in KG
On what abstraction is the data on the supply network?
    - returns the URI of the abstraction, i.e., the enterprise data structure instance
    -> correct result (if "Enterprise" wasn't the desired answer)
Which supply network abstractions can be derived from the given data?
    - uses describe() on the ontology URI (with empty hash) found in URIs of searched terms
    - does not understand that by "derived" other abstractions on higher level are wanted
    - returns abstarction of given supply network
    -> wrong result
How many tiers does the supply network have?
    - from the sn:SupplyNetwork instance, follows the sn:structure to look for tiers
    - writes a wierd query
    - does not grasp tiers
    - returns number of higher abstraction level links
    -> wrong result

- How to express direction of esn:supplier?
- How to express transitive n-ary relations?
- Do hash URIs for supply links between enterprises help or misinform? -> new dimension for knowledge representation for KGQA
- How to express derived abstractions?
- How to express tiers?
- How to define an abstraction?
- How harmful are blank nodes?
- The implementation of the search tool costs cycles
- A 400 bad request query result should hint the problem
- only one supply network in the KG is expected -> sn:supplyFlow comment unklar
